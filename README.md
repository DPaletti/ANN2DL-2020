Artificial neural networks and deep learning 2020 PoliMI course homework.
Three tasks:
- **Face mask classification**: given pictures of people with and without mask we had to classify images with regard to mask presence in the picture. For example, if 1 person out of an arbitrary number of people wears a mask the model would classify it to the positive class. If nobody wears a mask it would classify it to the negative class.

- **Semantic Segmentation**: this task comprises segmenting input images to identify crops, weeds and soil (background). Four different picture types (called teams) are available in the dataset and for each type of picture there is a further distinction between Haricot and Mais.

- **Visual Question Answering**: given a pair of an image and a written question we answer the question on the basis of the given image. For example, we may have a picture of dogs and a question asking how many dogs are in the picture.
